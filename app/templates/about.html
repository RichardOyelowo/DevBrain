        <h1>About DevBrain</h1>
        <p>
            DevBrain is a learning platform built around one core idea:
            understanding improves when knowledge is tested.

    <section class="about-mission">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            We aim to help learners strengthen their understanding through interactive quizzes
            that provide immediate feedback and measurable progress.
        </p>
        <p>Learning should be active, practical, and accessible — not passive or overwhelming.</p>

    <section class="about-philosophy">
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Memorization fades. Understanding sticks.</p>
        <p>
            DevBrain focuses on clear questions, honest scoring, and meaningful feedback
            so learners can identify gaps and improve efficiently.

    <section class="about-vision">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We envision a learning experience where progress is continuous,
            self-directed, and driven by curiosity rather than pressure.
        </p>
